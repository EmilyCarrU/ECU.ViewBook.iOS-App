Tours

Emily Carr offers Group Tours every Friday.

Tours begin at 12:00 noon and end at 1 p.m. We ask that you arrive 10 - 15 minutes early and meet in the Concourse foyer next to the reception desk in our North building. To book your tour please send your request and the date you wish to attend to: admissions@ecuad.ca.  Please note that due to operational limitations the University cannot accommodate groups exceeding 12 people.  It is also recommended that tour participants be 16 years of age or older.
