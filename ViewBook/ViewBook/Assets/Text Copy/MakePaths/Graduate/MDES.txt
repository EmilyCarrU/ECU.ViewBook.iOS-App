The Master of Design is a full time research-oriented, two-year degree in interdisciplinary design that challenges the status quo and addresses the continually disruptive nature of design studies by recontextualizing, remixing and reframing design, culturally, ecologically and theoretically.
The MDes will expand students' understanding of design in its contemporary and future contexts.  With students' existing knowledge of design practice as a foundation, which has been gained through undergraduate work and professional practice, this degree pushes the boundaries and purposes of design by integrating design research methodologies within theoretical, experimental and pedagogical frameworks.Students enrolling in the MDes program can expect to position themselves within a range of design studies including Health Design, Recreation Design, Soft Product Design, Communication Design, Product Design, Industrial Design, Sustainable Design, and Service Systems Design.Students graduating with an MDes will take leadership roles in a multitude of design professions, design research, teaching and pedagogy.
