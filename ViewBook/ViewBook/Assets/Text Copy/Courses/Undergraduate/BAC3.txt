Interaction Design fosters the integration and application of skills in physical and digital environments to help shape the way we interact with artifacts, information and environments in everyday life. Through hands-on projects based on a range of iterative human-centred modeling methods, you will investigate interactive wearables and mobile devices, online services and automated systems, sensor-activated environments and social networks, and systems that enable a more sustainable future.
