Industrial Design focuses on mediating human experience through the design of objects, systems, technology, environments, products and services, offering a rigorous program of hands-on study that emphasizes the understanding of human needs through exploration and prototyping in real time and space. You can choose to be an industrial design generalist, or focus your work on household products, recreational products, electronics, medical and health design, soft products, ceramics, exhibitions and furniture, as well as research in sustainability.
