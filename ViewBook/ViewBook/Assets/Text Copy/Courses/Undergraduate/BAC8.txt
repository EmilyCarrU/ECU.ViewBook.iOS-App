Explore the importance of art history, cultural theory and criticism while developing your studio practice.   More than half of your program will focus on academic courses like Art History, Design History, English, Humanities, Media History, Science and Social Sciences, with the remainder of your time in studio. This interdisciplinary approach allows you to connect theory and practice, and to bring modern and contemporary approaches to the creation of material and textual culture.
